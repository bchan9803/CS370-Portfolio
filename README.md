### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
- In this project, code was added to the program, so that the intelligent agent can find the treasure's location. Specifically, large amounts of code was provided by SNHU in the qtrain() function. Psuedocode and TODO comments were added, so that the developer could finish the code for the intelligent agent.  

### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science.  
- Computer scientists utilize their skills and expertise, in order to solve problems and develop software that accomplishes work. The work of a computer scientist matters, since a majority of everyday tasks are dependent on it. When it comes to approaching problems, they might utilize a number of techniques, such as determining what is the best possible solution. This may be done by comparing the strengths and weaknesses of each potential solution. In the context of this course, problems regarding AI could be solved by studying which reinforcement technique will provide the most optimal solution. However, there are ethical responsibiliies. An example of this, is the responsiblity to protect the users data. Since AI models require large amounts of data for training, it is imperative that the users data is sourced and secured in a manner that is not unethical.
